			<p><b>Synopsis:</b><br>
			"Learning by doing" (LBD) is the phenomenon where a worker's productivity
			rises with cumulative production experience. As LBD requires no additional
			investment in hiring or equipment investment, it is viewed by many as an
			important channel for firms to achieve productivity growth. Unfortunately,
			although conceptually simple and intuitive, the sources and enablers of LBD
			remain a mystery; as a result, even when a firm intends to facilitate LBD among
			its employees, it is not clear how to effectively achieve it. This challenge
			originates from the difficulty in quantifying and isolating the effects of LBD,
			and even in a few instances where the measurement of LBD effects (in terms of
			productivity) is made possible by natural events, these measurements are
			typically only at the aggregate level.</p>
			
			<p>In this project, the team aims to build a novel Big Data framework to measure
			the LBD effects for workers in the transport gig economy in Singapore. Our
			ambition is to measure LBD effects at not just the productivity level, which is
			easily tainted by other factors, but also at the skill level. We plan to achieve
			this by mining drivers' microscopic movement traces and trip fulfillment
			(including both taxi and ride-hailing drivers), and quantify drivers' skills in
			anticipating demands and competition from other drivers. Our research will
			provide a rare view into how big data can revamp the understanding of labor
			productivity and LBD effects at the individual level, and it will help policy
			makers and platform operators to come up with policies that are more effective
			in helping workers cope with competitions and sudden changes such as disruptions
			brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
