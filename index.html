	<p>His research focuses on the modeling and optimization of complex systems in engineering and business domains, with application in the areas of urban computing and human decision-making. He is particularly concerned about the real-world impact of his research. A prominent example of such pursue is all aspects of taxi fleet operations, where he has begun his investigations since 2008. His research interests cover fleet optimization, driver behavior analysis, agent-based simulation, labor economics of drivers, and the impact of ride-hailing innovation. Since 2017, he has been extensively testing an innovative Driver Guidance System for taxi drivers in both Singapore and Tokyo, helping drivers to reduce their vacant time by up to 35%. This research has received numerous prestigious international awards, including the <a href="http://www.cikmconference.org/CIKM2017/analytiCupfinals_winners.html">First Prize at the CIKM AnalytiCup: DataSpark Mobility Open-Task Challenge (2017)</a>, the <a href="http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/awardWinners">Best Deployed Application award at the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (2018)</a>, and being selected as the finalist at the <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/LYTX.2020.01.26n/full">INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award (2020)</a>.
