<h2>Two Research Scientist Positions at the Singapore Management University</h2>

<h3>Position 1: Mobility as a Service</h3>
<p>A research scientist position in the area of Mobility as a Service is available at the Fujitsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering (UNiCEN) Corp. Lab, Singapore Management University. The research scientist position is available immediately and offered for a one-year term.</p>

<p>The research scientist will be working with a research team to further develop and improve the Driver Guidance System (DGS) for taxi drivers, which has been in field trial since September 2017. Cumulatively, the DGS App has been downloaded and tested by more than 500 drivers. When actively following the DGS recommendations, drivers could lower their empty cruising time by 27% (for trail details, please see <a href="http://smu.sg/dgstrial">http://smu.sg/dgstrial</a>).</p>

<p>The DGS employs state-of-the-art demand prediction and large-scale optimization techniques to continuously generate high-quality recommendations for city-wide taxi operations. The team is currently improving the DGS App to make it more responsive to external events dynamically and to scale the system to support thousands of users, and the candidate is expected to play an important role in co-leading the effort.</p>

<h4>Qualifications</h4>

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Optimization, Computer Science, or related fields at the time of application. The candidate should be proficient in Java programming and comfortable with at least one statistical programming environment (e.g., R or Python). The candidate should also demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills.

<h3>Position 2: Crowdsourced Logistics</h3>
<p>A research scientist position in the area of Crowdsourced Logistics is available at the Fujitsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering (UNiCEN) Corp. Lab, Singapore Management University. The research scientist position is available immediately and offered for a one-year term.</p>

<p>The research scientist will be working with a research team to advance the state of the art in crowdsourced logistics, focusing on building both the optimization model and a prototype that will be ready for the field trial. The candidate is expected to play an important role in co-leading the project.</p>

<p>Our crowdsourced logistics platform is designed to provide dynamic recommendations for crowdsourced workers on what tasks to perform and guidances for the logistics service provider on what tasks to offer and task's incentives. The major novelty of our design is the incorporation of crowdsourced worker's movement patterns and location preferences, which greatly simplifies the decision making process of crowdsourced workers and generates task incentives that are responsive to the availability of crowdsourced workers.</p>

<h4>Qualifications</h4>

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Optimization, Computer Science, or related fields at the time of application. The candidate should be proficient in Java programming and comfortable with at least one optimization framework (e.g., CPLEX or Gurobi). The candidate should also demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills.

<h3>Application</h3>
For both positions, interested applicants should submit the following materials in application to <a href="mailto:sfcheng@smu.edu.sg">sfcheng@smu.edu.sg</a>:
<ul>
<li>Full CV with education and employment history.</li>
<li>Name and contact information for at least two references.</li>
<li>A written statement on research and/or project experience and interests.</li>
<li>Publication list and two sample publications (if any).</li>
</ul>

<h3>About UNiCEN</h3>

<p>The Fujitsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering (UNiCEN) Corp. Lab is jointly funded by the Fujitsu Limited and the National Research Foundation of Singapore under the Corp Lab @ University Scheme. UNiCEN is a synergistic industry-university partnership aimed at conducting industry-relevant R&D on combining computing, behavioral economics and management science approaches to create intelligent systems to address local urban challenges and conduct test-bedding in Singapore.</p>

<p>Our goal is to make substantial contributions in concepts, methods and enabling computational intelligence tools to address urban flow and resource management, demand and supply management and mass and personal flow control, in highly integrated and computationally practical and applicable ways.</p>


<h3>About Singapore Management University (SMU)</h3>

<p>A premier university in Asia, the <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/">Singapore Management University</a> (SMU) is internationally recognized for its world-class research and distinguished teaching. Established in 2000, SMU's mission is to generate leading-edge research with global impact and produce broad-based, creative and entrepreneurial leaders for the knowledge-based economy. SMU education is known for its highly interactive, collaborative and project-based approach to learning, and for its technologically enabled pedagogy of seminar-style teaching in small class sizes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/">School of Information Systems</a> (SIS) offers an exceptionally supportive and inspirational environment for academic scholarship and research, applied R&D projects, and innovative education initiatives. We currently have over 30 tenure-track faculty members working across research areas in computer science & engineering, and information systems management. They are complemented by around 20 practice & education faculty members who focus on teaching, translation and pedagogical research.</p>

<p>Real-world industry sectors provide SIS with a testbed and laboratory for experimentation, as well as a fertile breeding ground for new ideas. Our faculty and students apply their research results to solve real problems in a variety of industry settings and to create IT applications and systems. At the same time, our faculty actively publish in top-quality Computer Science and Management Science conferences and journals.</p>

<p>We are committed to supporting the development of our faculty. Besides start-up support and career mentoring for junior faculty, their Ph.D. students are funded by the school rather than paid from their research grants. SIS faculty members are encouraged to collaborate on innovative research projects and also on integrative and interdisciplinary projects. SMU as well as Singapore government agencies, such as the National Research Foundation, provide generous support for high-quality research proposals.</p>

<p>A noteworthy example of our funded research is the <a href="https://larc.smu.edu.sg/">Living Analytics Research Centre</a> (LARC), operated jointly with Carnegie Mellon University; LARC focuses on building technologies for Social Media Sensing and Analytics, and applying them in Singapore's Smart Nation initiatives. The school also hosts the <a href="https://livelabs.smu.edu.sg/">LiveLabs Urban Lifestyle Innovation Platform</a>, a city-scale research test-bed for researchers and organizations to run consumer behavioral trials and experiments with novel mobile services. In addition, SIS is the academic lead in the <a href="https://unicen.smu.edu.sg/">Fujtsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering Corporate Lab</a> (UNICEN), which focuses on urban mobility, logistics, and traffic management. In the area of Cybersecurity, SIS has a <a href="https://smc.smu.edu.sg/">Secure Mobile Centre</a> that conducts research into mobile device, cloud, and platform security.</p>

<!-- Our Education. SIS has a Ph.D. in Information Systems programme with about 70 students. Ph.D. students can concentrate in any of our computer science oriented research areas, or in our management science oriented Information Systems & Management research area.

The School offers Master of IT in Business (MITB), a professionally oriented coursework programme, which has nearly 300 students. The programme supports a Financial Technology & Analytics track focusing on FinTech and the integration of Technology & Operations in Banking, an Analytics track focusing on applied analytics for business, consumer and social insights, as well as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) track that emphasizes building AI-enabled business applications.

Additionally, we have well over 1,000 undergraduate students in our B.Sc. (Computer Science) and B.Sc. (Information Systems) programmes. The programmes have been remarkably successful in demonstrating educational innovations and creating a culture of learning, establishing external linkages and partnerships with industry, government and the social sector, and with job placement. We have an entrepreneurial student body, and many SIS undergraduates have gone on to create or participate in start-ups.
