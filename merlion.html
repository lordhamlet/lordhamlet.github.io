<p>Merlion is the code name of our software agent competing in the <a	 href="http://www.sics.se/tac/">Trading Agent Competition (TAC)</a>. We started our	 competition in 2008, and was the only new entrant in 2008 to advance to the finals. We ended up ranking 6th among 17 registered teams around the world.</p>

<p>We are planning our entrant again this year, and if you want to compete with some of the best software agent developers around the world, this is your 	chance to be part of the Team Merlion.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="tac2009.html">TAC-09</a> for the background 	 information on the competition. Our focus this year will include both the TAC Supply Chain Management and the TAC Ad Auctions. If you enjoy competing with the best, are highly motivated and committed, and are comfortable with algorithm design in Java, write me an email at: <u><font color="blue">sfcheng [at] smu dot edu dot sg</font></u>, I will be happy to discuss details with you.</p>

<b><u>More about Merlion</u></b>

<li>Automated trading.</li>
