<h2>Research Engineer Position at the Singapore Management University</h2>

We are inviting applications for a research engineer (RE) position in the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) at the Singapore Management University. The open position is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence technology to the modeling of human behaviors.

<p>In this project, the team aims to build a novel Big Data framework to measure the "Learning By Doing" (LBD) effects for workers in the transport gig economy in Singapore. Our ambition is to measure LBD effects at not just the productivity level, which is easily tainted by other factors, but also at the skill level. We plan to achieve this by mining drivers' microscopic movement traces and trip fulfillment (including both taxi and ride-hailing drivers), and quantify drivers' skills in anticipating demands and competition from other drivers.</p>

<p>We will work with a few well-known economists on applying AI techniques to some of the most difficult problems in labor economics.</p>

<p>The position is funded for up to 3 years.</p>

<h4>Application Procedure</h4>
<p>The project will be supervised by Prof. Shih-Fen Cheng. His research is in the area of AI+X, where he actively looks at how AI technology can be used in areas such as transportation, economics, crowdsourcing, and human decision making. His research outputs and deployed system have received prestigious international awards from CIKM, AAMAS, and INFORMS.</p>

<p>To apply, please indicate the position you are interested in, and send your resume to <b>sfcheng -at- smu.edu.sg</b></p>

<h4>Qualifications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bachelors/masters degree in Computer Science or a related computing focused discipline is required. Previous research experience is highly preferred</li>

<li>Excellent coding ability and experience in Python or C/Java is essential</li>

<li>Coursework in data structures and algorithms, probability and statistics</li>

<li>Experience with geospatial data analytics is a big plus</li>

<li>Please provide a sample of your significant project on github/bitbucket</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Singapore Management University (SMU)</h3>

<p>A premier university in Asia, the <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/">Singapore Management University</a> (SMU) is internationally recognized for its world-class research and distinguished teaching. Established in 2000, SMU's mission is to generate leading-edge research with global impact and produce broad-based, creative and entrepreneurial leaders for the knowledge-based economy. SMU education is known for its highly interactive, collaborative and project-based approach to learning, and for its technologically enabled pedagogy of seminar-style teaching in small class sizes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://scis.smu.edu.sg/">School of Computing and Information Systems</a> (SCIS) offers an exceptionally supportive and inspirational environment for academic scholarship and research, applied R&D projects, and innovative education initiatives. We currently have over 30 tenure-track faculty members working across research areas in computer science & engineering, and information systems management. They are complemented by around 20 practice & education faculty members who focus on teaching, translation and pedagogical research.</p>

<p>Real-world industry sectors provide SCIS with a testbed and laboratory for experimentation, as well as a fertile breeding ground for new ideas. Our faculty and students apply their research results to solve real problems in a variety of industry settings and to create IT applications and systems. At the same time, our faculty actively publish in top-quality Computer Science and Management Science conferences and journals.</p>

<p>We are committed to supporting the development of our faculty. Besides start-up support and career mentoring for junior faculty, their Ph.D. students are funded by the school rather than paid from their research grants. SCIS faculty members are encouraged to collaborate on innovative research projects and also on integrative and interdisciplinary projects. SMU as well as Singapore government agencies, such as the National Research Foundation, provide generous support for high-quality research proposals.</p>

<p>A noteworthy example of our funded research is the <a href="https://larc.smu.edu.sg/">Living Analytics Research Centre</a> (LARC), operated jointly with Carnegie Mellon University; LARC focuses on building technologies for Social Media Sensing and Analytics, and applying them in Singapore's Smart Nation initiatives. The school also hosts the <a href="https://livelabs.smu.edu.sg/">LiveLabs Urban Lifestyle Innovation Platform</a>, a city-scale research test-bed for researchers and organizations to run consumer behavioral trials and experiments with novel mobile services. In addition, SIS is the academic lead in the <a href="https://unicen.smu.edu.sg/">Fujtsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering Corporate Lab</a> (UNICEN), which focuses on urban mobility, logistics, and traffic management. In the area of Cybersecurity, SIS has a <a href="https://smc.smu.edu.sg/">Secure Mobile Centre</a> that conducts research into mobile device, cloud, and platform security.</p>
